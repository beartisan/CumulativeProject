# CumulativeProject

This is Cumulative Project part 1 where I am able to Create, Read, Update and Delete files from a database. This part creates a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
from a table using a Web API. 

In this project, I am tasked to create:
  - model class for SchoolDatabase
  - model class for Teacher
  - API controller for TeacherData
  - a controller for Teacher
  - a view for List
  - and a view for Show
  
With the controllers, models, and views given, once you run the server (via MAMP) and set-up the database, root, etc, you will be able to search and access the
data of teachers including their teacher Id, Employee Number, First and last name, Hire Date, and Salary. You can base this data from the PhpMyAdmin.
